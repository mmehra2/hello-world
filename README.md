# hello-world
Hi All,


I am Mansi Mehra. I am Software Engineer at HCL Technologies Ltd. I work on JAVA.
We use Spring framework for making our Java applications and database MySQL to work with the huge amount of application data.
We use hibernate also now a times.

This is my first GitHub project. Let's see what I learn from it.
